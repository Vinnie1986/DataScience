# Body Weight Prediction

## BEFORE USAGE

run the following:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## WHAT?

In the poultry sector it is important to know how much the average weight will be of a flock.
Can we predict the body weight in 7 days or at the end of the round (35 days) using several supervised learning methods?

we will try and predict the body zeight with a random forest and a long-short term neural network.
